# Coverage Audit

This page answers “is the project comprehensive?” with evidence instead of impression.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Implemented | Usable through the public SQL or storage path, tested, and explained. |
| 🟡 Partial | A teaching subset works, but important specification behavior is missing. |
| 📖 Explained | The concept is documented but production code is not present. |
| ⬜ Missing | Neither adequate implementation nor a complete chapter exists yet. |

“Implemented” never means “identical to SQLite” unless the compatibility column says so.

## Executive assessment

```mermaid
pie title Major SQLite subsystems by current maturity
  "Implemented teaching slice" : 3
  "Partial" : 6
  "Explained only" : 2
  "Missing" : 7
```

The project is comprehensive as a **map** after this audit, but not yet comprehensive as an
**implementation**. It is a restart-persistent, rollback-journaled single-process database with a
small SQL language and private page format. It is not a drop-in SQLite replacement.

## Exit criteria for “comprehensive SQLite implementation”

The project may call itself comprehensive only after:

1. every ⬜ row above becomes implemented or an explicit permanent non-goal;
2. private storage pages are either SQLite-compatible or the product name clearly stops claiming
   SQLite compatibility;
3. differential SQL tests compare supported semantics with the `sqlite3` executable;
4. generated corrupt files and crash points are exercised automatically;
5. concurrent access has a documented and enforced locking model;
6. the book has a runnable checkpoint and exercises for each subsystem.

Until then, README and release notes must state the narrower achieved milestone.
